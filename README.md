# IMDB Movie Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The **IMDB Movie Analysis** project explores a dataset of movies to uncover meaningful insights about budgets, genres, revenues, and ratings. The goal is to analyze factors influencing a movie’s financial and critical success, identify trends in genre popularity, and examine relationships between budget, revenue, and ratings. This analysis transforms raw movie data into actionable insights that can support decision-making in movie production, marketing, and content recommendation.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and inconsistencies for accurate analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Study patterns between budget, revenue, ratings, and genres.  
- **Visualizations:** Use heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts, and line graphs to illustrate trends.  
- **Insights Generation:** Extract key findings to understand factors contributing to movie success.

## Key Insights
- Certain genres consistently generate higher revenue.  
- Larger budgets do not always guarantee higher revenue or ratings.  
- Popularity trends shift over time, reflecting evolving audience preferences.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  
- GitHub for version control  
- Binder/Google Colab for interactive execution  

## Dataset
The dataset used is included in the `data/` folder as `movies.csv`. It contains information such as movie title, genre, budget, revenue, and ratings.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook: `notebooks/movie_analysis.ipynb`.  
2. Ensure required libraries are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).  
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce analysis and visualizations.

## Future Scope
- Include additional features like director, cast, and release season.  
- Build predictive models to forecast movie revenue or ratings.  
- Create an interactive dashboard for dynamic exploration of the dataset.  
- Expand analysis to include sentiment analysis of reviews or social media trends.
